<h1 align=center>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</h1>
<p>It's a non-fantazy RPG, made by Warhorse Studios, set in real historic period of an early 15 century Bohemia. KCD uses a unique combination of fictional and historical to tell it's story. For example, almost every Sir of every city, that main character meets, is a real historical person. Aswell as a game map itself, which is a region of Bohemia around town of Sasau, town of Rattay and a few smaller settlements. All of them are real, and recreated with precise attention to details. The game itself allows player to immerse in the world of medieval Czechia without a grain of fantazy elements. It's realistic, it's historical, and it's very interesting once you dive in.  </p>
